# Gameplay
**Genre: puzzle, adventure**

Ghost Trick is written and directed by the same person responsible for the Ace Attorney games. Unsurprisingly, they share a lot of common features.
The game plays much like a single large Ace Attorney case, spanning 18 chapters. Each chapter features puzzles that involve trying to prevent a character's death by travelling to 4 minutes before the death happens after witnessing it.

The core game mechanic involves manipulating the objects by switching between the ghost world and the real world. While in the ghost world, you can jump to nearby objects by stretching toward their object cores. While in the real world, you can perform ghost tricks on the object that you are currently latched onto. Different objects will perform different actions when ghost tricks are used. Typically, you'll perform a conjunction of ghost tricks in a certain way or timing to solve a puzzle. Later in the game, you gain control over a second character in addition to this, which enables you to swap positions of two similar-shaped objects.

While experimenting with different objects, it's usually possible to reach a state where the win condition is locked out. In this case, there isn't an explicit "game over" state. Rather, you simply rewind time back to 4 minutes prior to the character's death to try again. This is a clever way to seamlessly restart the game without interruption, while also being lore-friendly.

I thought the puzzles were fair too, since you could freely interact with independent objects without punishment before trying to manipulate them together. Rather than the typical obtuse logic of "trying every combination" that games in this genre usually have, Ghost Trick's puzzles felt somewhat intuitive to me, since each interactable object would show some kind of physical feedback to hint at what its effects were.

You can play the game entirely with a stylus on the touchscreen. I would recommend doing this, since it allows for smoother movement for sliding the camera and jumping between objects while in the ghost world. The alternative is to use the dpad, which felt a bit awkward for me.

I really liked the story and how it was presented. There were two scenes in particular that were memorable for me in its presentation.

The first is when I accidentally performed a ghost trick in front of the man in red and he noticed it. He then turns to face the camera and warns the player with a threat in a somewhat fourth wall-breaking manner. Given that, up until this point in the story, no other character could detect my ghost tricks, this was genuinely startling.

The second scene is the one from the climax of the final chapter, where all three ghost characters perform their own special abilities together in sequence. I found the scene to be quite emotional, since I didn't expect them to work together like that.

Each chapter ends with more mysteries to keep you hooked until the end, but the ending really wraps everything up nicely. Even the desk lamp character from the beginning, whom I thought to be just a throwaway tutorial character, was tied back into the story at the end.

# Visuals
This game has some really clean art. The character portraits are very expressive and bright.

The character models remind me of the characters from Dead Cells, in which they appear to be 3D models with a filter applied to make them look like 2D sprites.

Character animations are incredibly smooth, with a neat rotoscoping-like effect.

# Audio
Audio cues are set up in a similar way to the Ace Attorney games. There are distinct sounds that are played whenever a character is excited or notices something of interest. There is an "investigation" theme that plays during "trick time", and a "cornered" theme that plays when the death timer is near its end.

While I don't really remember specific tunes from the game, I do recall them being very fitting during my playthrough.

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 13 hours**

In my opinion, Ghost Trick does a better job keeping the player engaged in its story than the Ace Attorney games. This is because there is no downtime between chapters, unlike Ace Attorney's investigation sections in between courtroom sections. The puzzles being more fair also made it more fun for me as well. The writer brings that same kind of charm and humour in its character dialogue too, so it's just as entertaining to read through.

If you liked the Ace Attorney games, definitely give Ghost Trick a try.
