# Gameplay
**Genre: 2D side-scrolling platformer, city builder/simulation**

For the platforming sections, controls can feel clunky if you don't know specifically how the player character's movement is limited.
If you jump from a neutral position, you can readjust your character left/right in mid-air, but your character's facing direction is fixed.

If you jump while pressing left/right, your character will leap toward the pressed direction. In this case, you can't adjust the player's position in mid-air. Pressing the opposite direction from the character's movement will only stop the character's horizontal movement.

Attacking while crouching is slower than attacking while standing. When you land from a jump, there is a short duration in which the character is placed in a crouching state. This will affect your attack pattern and it might mess up your timing.

The platforming sections can feel quite difficult at times, with incoming attacks stunning and launching the player character (sometimes into holes or one-hit-kill spikes).

The combination of the above factors makes it sometimes feel like the player is fighting for control over their character, which can make the game frustrating.

Luckily, every attack you land on an enemy feels impactful. Most weaker enemies die in a single hit, whereas tougher enemies may take a larger fixed number of hits. As I played through the game, I began to recognize each enemy type and the specific number of hits required to kill them. There is a surprising amount rhythm and strategy to timing and counting your attacks.

Most bosses were fairly easy, given that I could cheese through a large portion of their health by using Magical Stardust. I was even playing the Japanese version of the game, in which magic costs more Sources of Magic per cast. The other 3 magic spells felt obsolete, either doing much less potential damage than Magical Stardust, or being too cost-prohibitive to be viable. The only instance where I couldn't abuse Magical Stardust was for the last act, since it consisted of a boss rush (and I wouldn't had had enough Sources of Magic to use on all of the bosses). In this case, I actually had to figure out each boss's attack patterns, which ultimately led to a more satisfying experience.

The simulation sections were quite engaging, despite its repetitive actions. The city-building mechanics were not difficult to grasp. From what I've read, in the Japanese version, building progress is 4 times slower than in the North American version. This didn't appear to make the game too grindy for me. I genuinely enjoyed reading the different townspeople's concerns.

# Visuals
The game does a good job at distinguishing the background from the foreground for the platforming sections. The background sprites are generally desaturated in colour, while the foreground sprites are vibrant.

Destroyable objects and power-ups are distinctly recognizable. Boss designs are appropriately menacing. I especially liked [the scene in Death Heim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3unRfRct8o) with the ring of demonic heads surrounding the player from above.

The simulation sections provide a clear overworld view of the cities. You can easily distinguish between the different building types and enemy types.

Any buildings or roads that you construct are also shown during [the descent transitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHyJH3GPIsA) before each platforming level. I thought this was a really neat visual effect.

# Audio
Sound effects are serviceable. Attack sounds sometimes cut out for some reason.

The music in this game is amazing. Yuzo Koshiro made some extremely memorable tunes for ActRaiser's soundtrack. My favourite track is the [Fillmore theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxCJJxoWwII).

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 12.5 hours**

ActRaiser may be a bit difficult to pick up due to the difficulty of the platforming sections. However, the North American version may be a viable alternative if this is an issue. Once you get used to the somewhat clunky controls, the game feels very rewarding to play (especially when you defeat the bosses).

The unique combination of genres makes the game interesting to play. I found myself engrossed in roleplaying the deity while serving the townspeople. If you're like me and you become too invested in the roleplaying, you may actually face moral dilemmas throughout the game (should I burn down these people's houses to make room for better technology?).

If anything, I would give it look just for the music alone.
