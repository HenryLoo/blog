# Gameplay
**Genre: stealth**

The game is heavily story-driven, with almost 4 hours worth of cutscenes (including codec conversations). Although this may turn some people away, I'm a sucker for Hideo Kojima's overly dramatic sci-fi military nonsense.

You play as Solid Snake, who is unarmed at the beginning of the game. There are a variety of weapons and items to discover, which I found to successfully enhance my sense of progression through the game (similar to my experience with Link to the Past).

The game is split into two distinct parts: stealth and boss fights.

Stealth mechanics involve playing around the radar to avoid enemy vision cones. The radar can be unusable in some areas or when you are detected by an enemy guard, which helps to increase tension. You can crawl on the floor or along walls to avoid making too much noise. You can also intentionally create noise distractions to lure enemies by knocking on walls. Typically, the weapon/item you find will be required to solve a puzzle in the area you found it in.

Boss encounters are unique from each other in the sense that each fight contains its own "puzzle" to solve in order to win. Each boss has some kind of weakness that the player must discover, usually by asking your codec contacts. The boss fight that really amused me was the Psycho Mantis one, in which he could predict and dodge all of your attacks by reading your mind. I thought it was pretty funny how his "mind-reading ability" was translated as simply reading your player inputs, and that to counter it, you would have to plug your controller into the player 2 port.

I found aiming with guns to be a bit tricky. Your character fires in the direction that he is facing, so you need to rotate until your gun appears to line up with your target. However, you can only face 8 directions. Pressing a directional input will cause your character to rotate to and stop at that direction. If you are already facing the direction of the input, you will move instead of rotating. So, firing at any angle in between these 8 directions will require you to hold down or repeatedly press the fire button while "scanning" the area. This often leads to missing a lot of shots and wasting ammo.

# Visuals
Although the 3D models clearly don't hold up to today's standards, it's well worth to note that all the cutscenes are rendered in-game. This is quite impressive for a game of this time.

The cinematography and atmosphere is still very good too. It's not hard to imagine that, with updated graphics, the cutscenes could pass for a AAA title today.

Yoji Shinkawa's character art still shines with its distinct style. This is mostly seen from the codec portraits.

# Audio
The game's sound design and music is top-notch. The iconic codec ring and enemy alert sounds will definitely stick with you.

Background music ranges from eerie to tense. Even the calmer/ambient tunes are somehow distinguishable for each area in the game.

All dialogue is fully voiced. The English voice-acting is mostly decent. You'll either love it or hate it.

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 11 hours**

I have plenty of nostalgia for Metal Gear Solid, but it wasn't until this playthrough that I truly dove into it in detail. I took as long as I could to explore and read/watch codec conversations.

My only complaint is the ending segment. The final boss fight felt poorly designed, with the boss seemingly gaining invincibility frames at random. He could sometimes do this while being hit by my attacks, and then immediately counter with his own attacks while I was still locked in my attack animation. Story-wise, I felt that the ending was a bit of out character for Snake too.

Aside from this, I can definitely say that Metal Gear Solid is one of my favourite games on the PS1. If you're interested in a simple but fun gameplay loop, combined with a gritty story, then Metal Gear Solid is worth playing. If you don't like the idea of watching cutscenes that might rival the length of movies, then that's a different story.
