# Gameplay
**Genre: 2D side-scrolling platformer**

While the game is fully 3D, platforming takes place solely on a 2D plane. Strangely, the game is fixed at 30 FPS, even though cutscenes are in 60 FPS. Luckily, the game is fairly slow-paced, so I didn't really notice it hindering my experience after playing it for a bit.

Like all Kirby games, your character can float and inhale enemies to copy their powers. For this specific title though, you can combine any 2 powers to create a new combined power. I found all the powers to be really entertaining to use and to look at. However, since all regular enemies die in one hit, this removes the "damage" factor when comparing powers. This makes it so that some powers are very clearly better than others. Specifically, powers that don't restrict your movement, can fire projectiles, and cover a large area are superior. For example, I found the cutter power to be quite weak, since it makes it so that Kirby can't perform multiple jumps while his projectile is thrown out.

Level design is fairly basic, with levels simply progressing from left to right. There is minimal platforming involved in most levels. Each level has 3 crystal shards that the player can collect. Collecting all crystal shards from every level will unlock the true final boss encounter. I found that a lot of crystal shards were placed in locations that were guaranteed to be missed during a first playthrough. This is because these crystal shards may be placed behind a wall that's only breakable by specific power combinations. In these cases, these powers would've had to have been acquired from an earlier part of the level, but you wouldn't be able to backtrack to gather them by the time you realized which combination you needed. By the time I beat the regular final boss, I had to essentially play through all the levels for a second time to grab the missing crystal shards.

I found all mid-bosses to be complete pushovers, especially if you have any power available. I have won mid-boss fights by simply standing still and holding down a single button.
Planet bosses are significantly more engaging, with attack patterns that encourage practice. I really enjoyed the Miracle Matter fight. The boss rush mode is surprisingly challenging too, since you're not allowed to use powers.

# Visuals
Aesthetically, each planet has very distinct and colourful environments. This includes, forests, deserts, volcanos, factories, etc.

Characters are very expressive during cutscenes, which made it enjoyable for me to watch.

Kirby's powers each have very interesting effects that encourage the player to try each combination out of curiosity.

The only minor issue I can think of is during one level, where there are dark-coloured cannons in the background. These cannons fire dark projectiles that blend into the background and make it difficult to notice.

# Audio
The soundtrack is too good. Every level track is upbeat. Without a doubt, I would've definitely not enjoyed the game as much as I did if it weren't for the music. My favourite tracks are the [Pop Star theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjFaq2rueKs) and the [Boss theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCYRvbSJOGE). The [Zero Two theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UALrmoYzZEc) is also appropriately tense for a final boss encounter.

The sound effects in this game are great too. Kirby's float and inhale sounds are easily recognizable. The sharp smacking sound when you take damage will haunt you throughout your playthrough if you attempt a no-damage boss rush clear.

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 7 hours**

Kirby 64 is a relatively basic platformer. It's a short game too. It shines with its amazing soundtrack, engaging boss fights, and visually-impressive power combinations.

It took me about 4 hours to complete the game at the regular final boss. It then took me another 3 hours to find all the crystal shards and defeat the true final boss.

If you're looking for a pretty relaxing game with great music, Kirby 64 is a good choice.
