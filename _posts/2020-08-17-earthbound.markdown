# Gameplay
**Genre: jrpg**

Earthbound plays like your typical turn-based JRPG. The JRPG components have with some slight innovations. Instead of random enemy encounters, enemies wander around and chase you in the overworld. You only battle enemies if they collide with you in this way. If they catch you from behind, then the enemies get 1 free turn at the beginning. If you catch the enemy from behind, then you get 1 free turn instead. For the most part, I found it impossible to successfully ambush an enemy, since they would always move faster than the player character and would beeline to you as soon as they have line of sight. The only time I could acquire this advantage was when you defeat an area's boss, in which case, the enemies will retreat from you by default afterwards.

The turn-based combat is fairly straightforward. The only interesting mechanics I can remember are:
- Each party member has their own inventory
- Rolling life counter

If your party member is dead, then you can't use items from their inventory.

The rolling life counter makes it so that, when a party member takes damage, their life ticks down gradually rather than instantly deducting by that amount of damage. This gives the player some time to recover from an attack if they navigate through the battle menus quickly enough. For the most part, I found the rolling life counter to be negligible. It wasn't until near the end game, that I could start to appreciate the "real-time" aspect that this mechanic brings. In the late game, some enemies have attacks that can deal more damage than your party member's max life. So in these cases, I had to rush through battle menus with basic attacks (the first option on the menu) so that I could quickly reach the heal options to mitigate the damage. I admit, this did add an element of excitement to the combat. However, this is also hindered by my main issue with Earthbound: menu speed.

The game features a lot of menu navigation. In between each menu, there is a small but noticeable delay before the menu is populated with its text and becomes interactable. You can't skip to the end of text for message boxes. You can't skip animations. If you accidentally speak to the same NPC or choose an option to repeat some text, you will have to step through that sequence from the beginning again. The dialogue can be interesting to read, but it doesn't vary between reads, so having to accidentally repeat them multiple times can be annoying.

You control fixed party of 4 characters: Ness, Paula, Jeff, and Poo. You start the game with only Ness in your party and then you gradually gain each additional party member one at a time as you progress through the story. Because of this, the early game combat is much less varied. With only Ness in my party, I found that there was usually only one viable combat option: to keep attacking with "Bash". Even once I acquired all 4 party members, there were clear balancing issues that severely limited my combat options.

All support PSI skills (offense/defence up, flash, paralyze, barrier) did not feel worth wasting a turn for. This is because I could be dealing damage instead, which would result in fewer combat turns and therefore mitigate any potential risks of taking additional damage. For offensive PSI skills, freeze seemed superior in every way compared to fire/thunder, since it dealt much more damage and had a chance to stun the enemy for that turn. Thunder misses too often to be viable. Fire was only used if there were more than 3 enemies in an encounter. Even in cases with many enemies, I sometimes found it more useful to use high single target damage just to guarantee that an enemy dies.

Ness's stats are overpowered by design. By the time I reached the final boss, Ness had over 700 life, which my other party members had at most mid 300's. Ness also had mid 500's levels of PP, while the other party members had around 200's. Jeff's bottle rockets could easily outdamage my other party members by 4 times the amount. Poo felt like an inferior version of Paula in terms of PSI damage, while his PP reserves are also too low for him to properly heal as often as Ness. These character imbalances didn't really bother me too much, but it was amusing enough for me to notice, so I think it's worth pointing out.

There are plenty of status effects to be inflicted with. I found it to be a bit overbearing at times, since it felt as though status effects were being inflicted faster than I could recover from them. There were points in the game where I had simply resigned myself to having some characters being inflicted with certain statuses and I just pushed through those sections while handicapped.

You can permanently miss some important items if you aren't paying attention. For example, Poo's ONLY weapon in the game, the Sword of Kings, can be unobtainable if you accidentally defeat a boss before grinding in that area. This is because, the enemies in that area permanently despawn after defeating the boss. There is also no indication that this enemy will drop this item. The only way to reliably figure this out is if you had looked up a guide beforehand. While the item itself is not necessary to be viable, this may annoy completionists.

I also felt that the story progression was disjointed. You're introduced to the overarching story from the beginning, as a simple "save the world" plot. However, the events that take place in between locations often did not seem to flow well together. I often found myself not being able to logically figure out where to go. The game designers seem to recognize this struggle as well, since they've included a dedicated "hint" NPC. If you pay this NPC some money, you're given a pretty straightforward hint on what to do next.

# Visuals
The sprites in Earthbound hold up well. They're fairly clean.

I enjoyed the "real life" setting that the game takes place in, as it provided some interesting enemy designs.

There are some genuinely frightening designs in the final boss (both the encounter itself and the environment leading up to the fight).

I found there to be a lack of visual feedback during combat. Attack animations are either simplistic or non-existant.

The abstract backgrounds during combat can be hit-or-miss, depending on your preferences. They typically don't reflect the environment in which you're fighting in, but they can be cool to look at.

# Audio
I found the sound design to be decent. Combat sounds were distinct.

I'm not sure how to feel about the music in this game. There were many tracks that I found to be forgettable, but there were also some very memorable tunes.

My favourite track was this [surprisingly emotional theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-w9OPgRbA). It flies in contrast to the game's largely quirky nature, just to remind the player that the context of the end goal is rather serious.

Which leads me to the [final boss theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLR4mnndnj0)... this is possibly one of the best final boss themes I've heard so far. The dynamic drop and change in instrumentation happens as quickly as you realize that the boss is using your own signature PSI skill against you. It sounds unlike anything from the rest of the soundtrack, and it works beautifully.

I can definitely appreciate the wide range of genres of music that this game covers.

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 25 hours**

Earthbound has some glaring flaws that clearly shows the game's age. It may be a difficult recommendation based on today's standards.

It could be worth checking out, out of curiosity from its cultural impact on video games. But, as a JRPG, I feel as though it is pretty average.

If you do manage to push through the slower parts of the game, the final boss encounter is well worth it in my opinion. While the early to mid game was at best engaging enough to let me progress through the game, and at worst boring to play, this final encounter's payoff ended on a high note for me.
