# Gameplay
**Genre: action, adventure**

The goal of the game is to explore the overworld to find dungeons, and then to clear these dungeons. There are equipment and health upgrades hidden across the overworld for the player to find. Each dungeon also has its own new equipment locked away in a large chest, with that piece of equipment usually playing a key role in solving its dungeon's gimmick. Overall, I enjoyed solving the dungeon puzzles. I had to refer to a guide several times in order to find out how to access some of the later dungeons though.

The game is fairly open-ended in how you can explore the world. You can attempt to tackle several sets of dungeons in any order. There is also a wide variance in difficulty based on how prepared you are in terms of equipment. The game does not stop you if you attempt a dungeon without finding the optimal (missable) items beforehand. It truly lives up to being an adventure game.

But while I can appreciate this lack of handholding, some may find it strange to balance the game's difficulty like this. Some encounters can be either overly frustrating or trivially easy depending on whether you have a specific item. For example, the Kholdstare boss in the Ice Palace takes either 8 shots with the Fire Rod to defeat its first phase or a single use of the Bombos Medallion (which also doesn't require any aiming). In addition to this, you can hold up to 4 Blue Potions, which each fully restores your health and magic meter. In my opinion, these potions completely trivialize the difficulty.

For combat, you can move in 8 directions, but only attack in 4 directions. Your sword hitbox feels deceptively small at times. This may lead to some awkward situations where an enemy is approaching you from a diagonal and you can't hit them. Enemies can also occupy the same space as you, so if they collide with you, they can manage to stay on top of you if they move fast enough. Since your sword hitbox does not extend from your character, but rather, only in front of your character, you can't hit enemies that are directly on top of you either. So this may result in an inescapable damage loop for the player. This tricky positioning issue is further exacerbated by some of the later dungeon designs, with slippery ice and conveyor belt tiles.

# Visuals
The sprites in this game are very clean. In fact, I'd say Link to the Past is probably the best-looking SNES game I've seen so far.

I liked how your character's weapon, armour, and shield sprites are updated based on which pieces you have acquired.

# Audio
Sound effects are used really well to convey certain game mechanics. For example, there are very distinct sounds to indicate when:
- Your sword is fully charged and ready
- An attack lands/is deflected
- Distinguishing between bombable walls and regular walls when tapping against them
- A dungeon room is cleared

The soundtrack also holds some good melodies. This includes the iconic Zelda overworld theme.
However, I don't hold any nostalgia for the Zelda series, so this theme didn't particularly stick with me.

Rather, my favourite tracks were the [Dark World overworld theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BStjuHfP238) and the [Dark World Death Mountain theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k2SPiGAs5A).

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 15.5 hours**

I enjoyed most of my time with Link to the Past. This was the second Zelda game I've played, and the first I've played to completion. Because of this, I found some difficulty in adjusting to the lack of direction when trying to progress through the game.

I also enjoyed seeing the various iconic items that have been referenced to by other games, such as the Pegasus Boots making an appearance in Terraria as the Hermes Boots.

Aside from the couple of annoying dungeons that interfere with control over the player character, this game is really solid.
