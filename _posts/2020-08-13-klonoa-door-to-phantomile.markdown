# Gameplay
- **☑ (Almost) always fun to play**
- ☐ Mostly engaging to play
- ☐ Mostly boring to play
- ☐ Frustrating/annoying to play

---

**Genre: 2.5D side-scrolling platformer**

Controls feel very responsive. Any errors in platforming can be fairly attributed to the player.

Klonoa can move left/right and jump (basic platformer movement).

Klonoa's ring allows you to inflate and capture enemies within a short distance in front of you.
After inflating an enemy, Klonoa will carry it above his head until you throw it.
While on the ground, Klonoa will throw the enemy forward.
While in the air, Klonoa will throw the enemy below himself and propel himself upward.

The game progresses linearly through a set of levels. Level design is very solid, where new game mechanics are always introduced to the player in a safe and non-intrusive environment before using them in a more challenging manner.

Difficulty scaling was smooth. The game was never too easy or too difficult.

# Visuals
- **☑ Very nice to look at**
- ☐ There are some good designs
- ☐ Not very distinct, but it works
- ☐ Noisy to look at and/or visuals hurt the play experience

I liked the character designs and how the overall colour palette was vibrant.

The game uses 2D character sprites along with 3D environments. This makes it very easy to discern the foreground obstacles from the background, which is very important for side-scrolling platformers.

While the player's movement is fixed to a 2D plane, this plane can shift along with the camera when the camera moves to different depths in the environment. I thought this led to some pretty neat visual effects which helped to keep me engaged with the game. For example, check out [this level](https://youtu.be/zVvjEKLxffM?t=118), where the camera moves around a spiraling tower.

# Audio
- **☑ Very enjoyable to listen to (both music and sfx)**
- ☐ There are some good tunes
- ☐ Nothing stands out
- ☐ The music/sound design hurts the play experience

Sound effects provide distinct feedback to player actions, like collecting gems or throwing enemies.

I enjoyed listening to every music track. They range from [lighthearted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IElJndRMfto) to [surprisingly emotional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gss1es9qLdE).

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 8.5 hours**

Klonoa: Door To Phantomile was very enjoyable to play. It's an easy game to pick up due to its lighthearted nature.

This was one of the few titles where I had zero complaints during my playthrough.

I was too emotionally invested in the game, so the ending hit me pretty hard.

>**Highly recommended**
