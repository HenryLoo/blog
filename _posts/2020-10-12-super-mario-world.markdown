# Gameplay
**Genre: 2D side-scrolling platformer**

Much like the previous titles in the series, you play as Mario to navigate through various worlds and levels to rescue Princess Peach/Toadstool from Bowser.
You can also play cooperatively with a second player (Luigi).

The controls are fairly straightforward. You can walk left and right, duck, and jump. You can also jump while ducking to maintain a shorter hitbox.
Super Mario World also introduces the spin jump, which acts as a shorter jump but can defeat most enemies and destroy some blocks.

Most of the time, you will be holding down the run button instead of simply walking. Otherwise, you'll be much too slow to dodge enemies or even leap far enough for regular platforming.
Acceleration is not instant, so you will have to account for the time it takes to grind to a halt when you stop holding down the move buttons.
I didn't like how slippery the movement felt. Even at the final level, I would be accidentally running off ledges for not stopping earlier, or overshooting my jumps and missing platforms entirely.
I can understand that, if mastered, players can perform some neat-to-watch platforming with these controls. But, I'm generally not a fan a of momentum-based platformers because the lack of instant acceleration/deceleration evokes the same dissonance as input lag for me.

There are 3 types of power-ups that you can pick up. Each power-up will allow you to take an extra hit before dying (you'd normally die in a single hit). The red mushroom item will simply make your character larger, along with a taller hitbox. The fire flower will make your character larger along with giving you the ability to shoot fireballs by pressing the run button. The cape feather will make your character larger along with allowing you to perform a spin attack, fly, and descend more slowly.

I found the cape to be a bit of a cheat item. Not only does it allow you to easily defeat most enemies by spinning, but it also allows you to outright skip outdoor levels by flying over them from start to finish. The slow descent feature also makes platforming much more forgiving.

Yoshi also makes his debut in the Mario series in this game. If you find a Yoshi egg, you can hatch it for a Yoshi mount. While riding on Yoshi, taking a hit will merely knock you off the mount instead of killing you instantly. You can immediately hop back onto Yoshi to regain this hit buffer. Pressing the run button while mounted will perform a tongue attack, defeating most enemies. Jumping on enemies with Yoshi also appears to have the same effectiveness as using a spin jump. You can also essentially perform a double jump by first jumping with Yoshi, and then jumping off of Yoshi while in midair.

Aside from the platforming itself, the game features a neat overworld map to illustrate each world's theme. Whenever you clear a level, the map updates itself with small visual changes along with new branching paths to subsequent levels. I liked how some levels had alternate exits, which when crossed, would result in different paths opening on the overworld map. There were some pretty neat moments from accidentally discovering secret exits.

The game's difficulty felt inconsistent to me. Some of the later levels were easier than the earlier levels. In general, there didn't feel like a "ramp" in difficulty as you progressed through the game. Difficulty seemed rather uniform across all levels, with the exception of the castle levels. Castle levels were noticeably more difficult, due to being ridden with many instant kill obstacles (holes, lava, scrolling halls with walls that can crush you). I did find it a bit jarring that the boss encounters at the end of each castle level were significantly easier than the actual level itself. Half of the boss fights are recycled, with minor environmental changes.

I'm not sure why the game is designed so that you can only save your progress after clearing a ghost house, castle, or switch palace. If this was intended to motivate players to push past a set of stages at a time to reach certain "checkpoints", then this design had failed. This is because, you can simply repeat previously cleared ghost house levels to save at "any time". So why not just allow players the convenience of saving at any time to begin with?

# Visuals
Super Mario World's sprites manage to capture that timeless feel, much like Zelda (Link to the Past). The game looks vibrant and clean.
It's the kind of art direction that makes you feel nostalgic just by looking at it, even if you don't have any past experience with the game.

Visual clarity is very good, with clear differentiation between foreground and background.

# Audio
The game recaptures some of the classic Mario themes with its new soundfont, as well as introducing some new iconic themes of its own.
Even people who haven't played Super Mario World before can recognize tunes like [Athletic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8zR-jwlZvU) and the [Course Clear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zmb9Vh8Ja0) jingle.

The sound design is also topnotch. Everything you interact with provides a distinct sound effect, such as collecting coins, jumping, mounting on Yoshi, and performing spin jumps.
I don't think I'll ever forget these sounds.

# Conclusion
**Total Playtime: 8.5 hours**

Super Mario World is a solid game. This was the first Mario game that I've completed (with the exception of the special levels), and the second that I've really played. So, I don't have much nostalgia for the series.

From what I've read about the game, it's supposed to be held in very high regard for a lot of people.
Because of this, I kind of started playing with high expectations. The visuals and audio are great, but from a gameplay perspective, I'm a little bit a disappointed.

I can see why the game is considered the "gold standard" of 2D platformers. What it does, it does very well. The game still holds up to today's standards for sure.
Without a doubt, the biggest aspect of the game that is limiting my enjoyment is the slippery controls. This was what often devolved the feeling of challenge to mere frustration for me.
But at the same time, these controls are part of the identity of the 2D Mario games.
If they were simply changed to have exact 1-to-1 response with instant acceleration, you'd be removing a core feature of the game, along with all the other impressive platforming feats that you'd typically find from videos of pro players. So I can't fault the game for this.

If you're a fan of Mario games, you'll definitely enjoy this. If you like other momentum-based platformers, like Super Meat Boy, you'll probably enjoy Super Mario World too.
